# Blender

Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipelineâ€”modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation.  
Blender is also compatible with modding 3D assets for Empire at War Forces of Corruption thanks to Gauklers Alamo Tools for Blender.

## Fixing Non-Manifolds

You will need to be on Edit Mode, with Vertex or Edge selection to be able to select by Non Manifold. Be sure to deselect anything before otherwise it will add Non Manifold to your selection.

Some non-manifold can be fixed automatically by Delete Loose, Degenerate Dissolve, Merge by Distance or Fill Holes. Delete Loose can solve automatically level 6 and 7. Merge by Distance can solve the level 3 but also can produce a non-manifold like the one you see in level 8 and 9!
